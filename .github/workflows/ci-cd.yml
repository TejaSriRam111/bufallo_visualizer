Here is a basic example of how you could structure your GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD and deployment using GitHub Actions, Vercel, and EC2. Please note that this is a simplified example and may need to be adjusted based on your specific project requirements.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (CI pipeline)
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: flutter/setup-flutter@latest
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.dart_tool/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-dependencies
      - name: Build
        run: flutter build

# .github/workflows/cd.yml (CD pipeline)
name: CD
on: [push]
branches:
  only:
    - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.ref }}  # Use the branch that triggered the workflow
      - name: Setup Flutter
        uses: flutter/setup-flutter@latest
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.dart_tool/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-flutter-dependencies
      - name: Build and Serve (Vercel)
        uses: vercel/cli@latest
        with:
          command: deploy --prod
      # Uncomment the following line to use Render instead of Vercel
      # - name: Build and Deploy (Render)
      #   uses: render/render-cli@latest
      #   with:
      #     command: deploy production
      # For EC2 deployment, you would need to create an AWS ECS task definition, build a Docker image, push it to ECR, and run the AWS ECS CLI to deploy.

# Example for deploying to EC2 (replace placeholders with your actual values)
# - name: Build Docker Image
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#   container: docker
#   steps:
#     - name: Build image
#       run: docker build -t my-image . && docker push my-ecr-repo:latest
# - name: Deploy to EC2
#   uses: aws-actions/ecs-deploy@v3
#   with:
#     cluster: my-cluster
#     taskDefinition: my-task-definition
#     region: us-west-2
```

After deploying successfully, you can add the deployment URL as a comment using GitHub's REST API or Action. However, it is beyond the scope of this example to demonstrate that. You may want to look into the `actions/github-script` action for this purpose.
